            <h3><br>
                Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.
                In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, 
                regardless of their culture of origin.Paper was first invented in China around 105 A.D., 
                and was brought to Japan by monks in the sixth century.
                Handmade paper was a luxury item only available to a few, 
                and paper folding in ancient Japan was strictly for ceremonial purposes, often religious in nature.
